# Ruan Cardoso Comelli

Software engineer specializing in developer tools and automation, building robust systems for code quality and LLM integration.

## About

I'm a software engineer who loves building tools that make developers' lives easier. My journey started in mechanical engineering and scientific computing, which gave me a unique perspective on solving software problems - whether it's with traditional algorithms or cutting-edge AI.

I focus on creating practical solutions that combine solid engineering practices with smart automation. My goal is simple: make codebases easier to maintain and development workflows smoother. I love building tools that developers love using.

When I'm not working hard, you can find me playing beach volleyball (with more enthusiasm than skill) or exploring the beautiful island of Florianópolis with my two adorable chihuahuas.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer at Sourcery (2021 – 2025)

[https://sourcery.ai](https://sourcery.ai)

- Designed and implemented LLM-powered systems for automated code review and bug fixing
- Re-architected and maintained an event-driven GitHub/GitLab bot infrastructure supporting natural language comment commands
- Implemented automated PR titles and summaries; Mermaid diagram visualization; and security-focused reviews — all widely adopted and loved by users
- Built evaluation datasets and scripts for AI-generated patches, using LangSmith for testing and observability
- Improved our CLI, GitHub Actions, and IDE extensions to streamline workflows and increase adoption
- Led codebase modernization by replacing Black and PyLint with Ruff, making linting and formatting near-instantaneous; upgraded Python/runtime dependencies for a smoother dev experience
- Enhanced our static analysis engine and added linting and refactoring rules

### Tech Lead at Elint (2021)

[https://www.elint.io/en](https://www.elint.io/en)

- Led a team in developing a proof-of-concept for automated PDF data extraction, successfully delivering a solution that was adopted by the client
- Architected and implemented a custom OCR solution that outperformed state-of-the-art commercial tools, including Google Vision, by combining Tesseract with modern open-source models
- Designed and implemented serverless document processing pipelines using infrastructure-as-code
