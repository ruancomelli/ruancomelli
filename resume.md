# Ruan Cardoso Comelli

I am a software engineer specializing in AI-driven developer tools, automation, and code quality enhancement. With expertise in integrating LLMs into practical applications, I deliver solutions that transform raw data—such as GitHub commit logs—into actionable insights. At Sourcery, I've been at the forefront of developing intelligent code review systems, automated bug fixing tools, and structured dataset creation for AI evaluation.

I'm deeply invested in developer productivity and code maintainability, building systems that not only generate AI-assisted code fixes but also integrate them seamlessly into CI/CD workflows. I believe that artificial intelligence augments developers' capabilities rather than replacing them. Open-source collaboration is central to my approach—I actively contribute to tools that improve how developers interact with AI in software engineering.
